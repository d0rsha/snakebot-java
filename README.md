## Implementation

There is only one class in this project, have a look at SimpleSnakePlayer.java. The main method to start in looks like this:

```java
@Override
public void onMapUpdate(MapUpdateEvent mapUpdateEvent) {
    ansiPrinter.printMap(mapUpdateEvent);

    // Choose action here!
    registerMove(mapUpdateEvent.getGameTick(), SnakeDirection.DOWN);
}
```

For every MapUpdateEvent received your are expected to reply with a SnakeDirection (UP, DOWN, LEFT or RIGHT).
